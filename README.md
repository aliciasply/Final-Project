# Background and Motivation: 

In the age of social media, it has become more important than ever to be wary of what we read on all platforms. Social media has made it easier to connect with the world and has great influence on the masses as anyone can share anything. What we wanted to do was to find a way to weed out the real news from the fake news. And, more importantly, we wanted to find a way to measure the impact that fake news has on society as a whole.
